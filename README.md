# Sentiment Analysis

The project demonstrates sentiment analysis using a bag of words model on reviews from Amazon of kitchen products. In the data set, each review is classified as positive or negative. Our goal is to train a classifier that determines the classification, given a bag of words (already done in the data set).

Two classifers are illustrated: a decision tree model and linear regression. The regression scores higher accuracy (around 86% vs. around 74% for the tree). Blind guessing should give around 50%.
